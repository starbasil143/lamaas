Heyy, since you're up, would you mind running a little errand for me?
+ [Yes]
+ [No]

- Great! When you have time, go ahead and run up to Mallory's place.
She was supposed to supply us with a shipment of iron yesterday, but I haven't heard from her. 
I won't be able to work the forge without that iron. Just make sure she's okay. Thanks, Lamaas!
